# 🛠 What's New: Logo, SVG Export, and Donation Page

We're continuously improving our project and are happy to share the latest features added in the past few days:

---

## ✅ 1. Logo Support on Images

You can now upload your own logo and place it over the generated image.  
Perfect for keeping your brand style consistent or protecting your content.

**Supported:**
- Upload PNG/JPEG files
- Positioning and scaling the logo
- Transparent background

---

## ✅ 2. SVG Export

Alongside the regular PNG format, you can now also download your result as a **clean SVG file**.  
Great for those working with vector graphics or embedding directly into HTML/CSS.

---

## 💸 3. Donation Page

Since this project is 100% free and open to everyone, we added a small **donation page with crypto wallets**.

If you'd like to support development — feel free to send some crypto 💙  
👉 Page: [Donate](https://qrafty.cutbg.org/en/donate)
